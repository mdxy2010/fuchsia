# This script takes a network interface (eg: tap0) as its only argument. It sets
# up that interface for running a Fuchsia device. It runs dnsmasq to provide
# DHCP and DNS to the Fuchsia device. It configures NAT. It will do its best to
# kill old instances of dnsmasq from previous runs of the script for this
# interface.
#
# It can be passed with -u as a start-up script to run-zircon-* or frun to
# bring up a network for a new qemu instance
#
# If the environment variable FUCHSIA_IP is set it will give that IP to the
# Fuchsia device, otherwise, for historical reasons it will allocate
# 192.168.3.53.
