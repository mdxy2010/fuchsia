// These routines provide loader service implementations that
// some users of liblaunchpad may need.  They are compatible with
// dl_set_loader_service() and are primarily used by devmgr (to
// provide the default system loader service) and clients of
// launchpad that need a specialized variant loader.
//
// Terms:
// "loader service": A channel that speaks the protocol expected by
//     dl_set_loader_service(). The service behind the channel receives
//     load requests (e.g., "libhid.so") and returns VMOs that contain
//     the data associated with that name.
// "local loader service": An in-process loader service.
// "system loader service": A loader service, provided by the system,
//     that is shared by multiple processes.

// Type of the hook for loader_service.  The first argument is
// the one passed to loader_service_simple(), and the second specifies
// which load service was requested (the opcode from zx_loader_svc_msg_t).
// The remaining arguments' meaning depends on the opcode.
